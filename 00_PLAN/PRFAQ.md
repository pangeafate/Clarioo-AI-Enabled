## Clarioo Launches AI Assistant to End "Voodoo Buying" for B2B Software

**Neutral AI Assistant Helps Mid-Market Companies Navigate Tech Stack Chaos, Stakeholder Alignment, and Decision Paralysis**

**London, UK – June 1, 2026** – Today, Clarioo launched its AI assistant that transforms how companies discover, evaluate, and purchase B2B software. The assistant addresses the growing complexity buyers face as AI creates 10-100x more software options over the next 24 months, helping them move from "voodoo buying" to evidence-based decisions with transparent, data-driven vendor assessments.

The B2B software landscape is becoming exponentially more difficult to navigate. CFOs at mid-market companies are overwhelmed by tech proliferation, department heads handed mandates to "find a solution" lack evaluation frameworks, and CxOs struggle with tech stack chaos across 40+ tools with no memory of why tools were chosen. Meanwhile, traditional discovery and selection processes remain manual, time-consuming, and heavily dependent on biased sales interactions.

"Software buying today is fundamentally broken," says Olga Kotsur, CEO and Founder of Clarioo. "Companies spend months on 'voodoo buying' – distributed decision-making without clear criteria, heavy reliance on seller narratives, and decision paralysis from information overload. With AI creating thousands of new solutions monthly, this problem is exponentially worse. Clarioo puts control back in buyers' hands with neutral, evidence-based analysis."

### The Problem Clarioo Solves

Software buying today creates overwhelming anxiety and career risk for decision-makers:

**Tech proliferation paralysis.** With AI creating 10-100x more software options in 24 months, CxOs and department heads face overwhelming choice and FOMO. Are you falling behind competitors because your tech stack is inadequate? You don't have time to research, and your team lacks evaluation competence.

**Mandate without methodology.** Department heads get told "find an HR system by Q1" but have no framework. The result: analysis paralysis, career anxiety, and 80% vendor-driven decisions where you're essentially letting sales teams educate you about their own products. With 10-11 stakeholders involved, endless alignment meetings, and conflicting spreadsheets, you end up with decision paralysis or choices based on sales mastery rather than product fit.

**Tech stack chaos and renewal amnesia.** COOs managing 40+ tools don't know if they're over-tooled or under-enabled. When renewal time comes, you can't remember why you chose a vendor two years ago, putting you in a weak negotiation position and leaving 20-30% savings on the table.

### The Clarioo Solution

Clarioo's AI assistant turns "voodoo buying" into evidence-based decision-making, giving you back control while serving both buyers and vendors.

**For Buyers,** Clarioo offers:

**Criteria Engine** that turns project goals and policies into explainable, weighted scorecards with granular feature lists, architectural requirements, and security requirements. The engine facilitates internal collaboration and alignment, turning vague requirements into structured evaluation frameworks.

**Evidence-based discovery and evaluation** that analyzes vendor websites, documentation, testimonials, and third-party sources to automatically populate criteria matrices. Each score includes evidence links, confidence ratings, and transparent sources – eliminating black-box AI recommendations.

**Consensus Builder** that orchestrates stakeholder communication, highlights disagreements, and helps teams reach decisions without endless committee meetings.

**Real-time meeting co-pilot** that supports decision-makers during demos and Q&As, fact-checking vendor claims against the scorecard and broader competitive context, saving the typical 15 minutes of context setup at the start of demos.

**Executive Summary** that provides 3-paragraph briefings highlighting what to watch for in demos, each vendor's strengths and weaknesses, key questions, and non-obvious considerations – like having a star analyst prep you before critical meetings.

**Decision Memory** that preserves the complete rationale, accepted risks, and stakeholder input, enabling evidence-based renewal negotiations and post-implementation accountability.

**For Vendors,** Clarioo provides:

**Qualified Leads** with detailed requirements and initial evaluation context – no more time wasted on "tire kickers" or mismatched prospects.

**Evidence Pack Validation** allowing vendors to validate pre-populated assessments and provide verifiable evidence (security docs, capability demonstrations, case studies, references) through structured workflows.

**Transparent Communication** within guardrails, allowing vendors to meaningfully engage with buyer requirements without gaming the system.

**Objective Win/Loss Intelligence** revealing real reasons for deal outcomes based on buyer evaluation data – invaluable market intelligence typically unavailable through traditional sales channels.

**Deal Stage Visibility** based on actual prospect engagement and progress through evaluation stages, enabling more accurate forecasting.

The AI assistant operates on a simple pricing model: low cost for buyers (with premium tiers for complex multi-party processes) and vendor-side monetization through modest success fees (3-7% of Year 1 ACV) plus optional premium subscriptions for analytics, evidence pack management, and extended visibility into market trends.

"We needed to evaluate parking technology providers across 15 different criteria for a 5-year contract," says a fictional early adopter, Head of Operations at a major European airport. "Clarioo turned what would have been 3 months of manual research, conflicting spreadsheets, and sales pitches into a 3-week structured process with clear evidence for each score. Our procurement team, IT security, and operations aligned on requirements in days instead of weeks. When we went to the board with our recommendation, we had complete traceability of our decision process."

### How Customers Experience Clarioo

The buying process starts simply. A user describes their need – whether explaining a problem ("I need to improve sales team productivity"), naming a vendor they're considering ("Tell me about LevelPath and compare with similar solutions"), or requesting tech stack analysis ("We use HubSpot and Clay, what else might help us?").

Clarioo's AI immediately begins building a criteria framework through conversational interaction, suggesting relevant requirements based on user context while allowing full customization. Within minutes, users have their first tangible output: a structured criteria list that brings order to chaos and gives a sense of control over the process.

For simple purchases ($20-50K), the AI assistant quickly generates battle cards comparing vendors against criteria with evidence links, provides executive summaries for demo prep, and facilitates quick demo booking. After demos, vendors receive evaluation feedback – unprecedented transparency in B2B sales.

For complex purchases ($100K+), Clarioo adds vendor validation steps before demos (ensuring accuracy for high-stakes decisions), multi-stakeholder collaboration workflows, structured RFP processes, and comprehensive decision memory. Throughout the process, the AI assistant eliminates "committee meeting" waste by asynchronously gathering input and highlighting where alignment is needed.

The experience feels like having a brilliant analyst on your team – one who never tires, has perfect memory, knows the entire vendor landscape, and works at AI speed while remaining completely neutral.

"Companies that embrace Clarioo typically report 60-70% reduction in time-to-decision, significantly higher confidence in vendor selection, and better post-purchase outcomes because the decision rationale is preserved," notes Olga Kotsur. "But equally important is the cultural shift – teams stop arguing about spreadsheets and start having strategic conversations about what truly matters for their business."

# FREQUENTLY ASKED QUESTIONS

## CUSTOMER FAQ

### Why should I care?

**Q: We already use G2, Gartner, and talk to our network. Why do we need Clarioo?**

A: G2 and Gartner provide vendor information and reviews, but they don't help you define your specific requirements, compare vendors against YOUR criteria with evidence, or facilitate your internal decision process. Your network provides valuable input, but it's anecdotal and rarely comprehensive. Clarioo integrates all these sources while adding structure, evidence linking, and decision workflow that takes you from "I need something" to "Here's why we chose this vendor" in a fraction of the time with complete traceability.

**Q: How is this better than just using ChatGPT to research vendors?**

A: ChatGPT gives you general information but doesn't provide evidence-linked assessments, stakeholder collaboration tools, vendor engagement workflows, or decision memory. Clarioo is purpose-built for B2B software buying with vendor-specific data sources, evidence pack validation, confidence scoring, and the ability to trace your complete decision rationale. It's the difference between asking advice from a smart friend and hiring a specialized consultant with a structured methodology.

**Q: What problem does Clarioo solve for me?**

A: If you've ever felt overwhelmed trying to figure out what software you need, spent weeks building comparison spreadsheets only to have them become outdated or challenged, struggled to align multiple stakeholders on requirements, or made a software purchase and later couldn't recall why you chose that vendor – Clarioo solves all of this. It turns "voodoo buying" into evidence-based decision-making.

### What is this, how does it work?

**Q: How does Clarioo work?**

A: Start by describing your need in natural language or select a pre-defined scenario. Clarioo's AI builds a requirements framework through conversation, generates a list of relevant vendors, and creates evidence-based comparison matrices. For each vendor and requirement, you see specific evidence with confidence ratings and source links. You can collaborate with colleagues asynchronously, vendors can validate and add evidence, and the platform guides you through demos and final decision-making while preserving complete memory of your rationale.

**Q: What does the offering include?**

A: The base tier includes discovery, criteria building, vendor comparison matrices, executive summaries, and demo coordination for simple purchases. The premium tier adds multi-party collaboration, vendor validation workflows, RFP management (?), meeting co-pilot functionality, and extended decision memory. The enterprise tier includes custom integrations with procurement and spend management systems, dedicated success management, and priority support.

**Q: How will the product fit into my process?**

A: Clarioo fits in the evaluation stage – after you've identified a need but before you've committed to a vendor. For simple purchases, it replaces ad-hoc research and Excel spreadsheets. For complex purchases, it integrates with your existing procurement workflow, sitting between initial requirement definition and contract negotiation. It doesn't replace your procurement or legal teams; it arms them with better information faster.

**Q**How much does it cost?

A: Basic use starts free for simple vendor comparisons. Premium plans range from US$ XXX/month for small teams to US$ XXX/month for enterprises, based on number of concurrent evaluation projects and stakeholders. Alternatively, pay per evaluation starting at US$ XXX for simple assessments up to US$ XXX for complex multi-party processes. Enterprise custom pricing available.

**Q: Where is my data stored and who can see it?**

A: Your evaluation data is stored in SOC 2-compliant secure infrastructure with encryption at rest and in transit. By default, your evaluation criteria and scores are private to your organization. You control if/when vendors see information (and can choose to share partial criteria before they accept the lead). You can optionally share anonymized decision outcomes with the Clarioo community to help improve platform intelligence, but company-identifying information is never shared without explicit permission.

**Q: Can I integrate Clarioo with my existing tools?**

A: Yes. Clarioo integrates with calendar systems (Google, Outlook) for demo scheduling, note-taking tools (Firefly, Notion) for meeting capture, and can export data to Excel/CSV for use in procurement systems. Enterprise plans include API access and custom integrations with spend management platforms (Coupa, SAP Ariba) and procurement tools (LevelPath, Zip).

### What do I do if I'm interested?

**Q: How do I get started?**

A: Visit [clarioo.com](http://clarioo.com) and click "Start Evaluation." Describe what you're looking for – you don't need to create an account until you want to save your work or move to vendor engagement. Most users get initial results within 30 minutes.

**Q: My company is based outside the US/Europe – can I use this?**

A: Clarioo works globally. Our vendor database includes companies worldwide, and the platform supports multiple languages. Some regional vendor databases (especially in APAC) are still growing, but the platform works with any vendor that has a web presence.

**Q: I'm looking for very niche/new technology – will Clarioo have relevant vendors?**

A: Clarioo's AI searches across multiple sources including startup databases, Product Hunt, tech blogs, and funding announcements. For truly cutting-edge categories, you may see fewer vendors than in established categories, but you can always add vendors manually and Clarioo will research and score them. The platform's value isn't just in finding vendors – it's also the structured evaluation and decision-making.

**Q: Can I try before committing?**

A: Absolutely. Start an evaluation for free – no credit card required. You'll see the full evaluation process and results. Payment is required only when you want to engage vendors for demos or use premium collaboration features. Many users complete initial evaluations to assess Clarioo itself before committing.

## STAKEHOLDER FAQ

### Business Opportunity

**Q: What business goals are we targeting?**

A: Clarioo targets the $100B+ B2B sales and marketing spend market, specifically the inefficient components: SDR/outbound spend ($30B+), sales process time that could be eliminated ($40B+), and software selection consulting fees ($10B+). Our goal is to capture 1-2% of this market within 5 years, becoming the standard infrastructure for B2B software evaluation.

**Q: How does this align with market trends?**

A: Several macro trends favor Clarioo's growth:

- **AI proliferation**: Expected 10-100x growth in software companies over 24 months as AI lowers barriers to software creation, making discovery exponentially harder
- **Buyer empowerment**: Shift from seller-led sales to buyer-led purchasing (Gartner predicts 80% of B2B purchases will be self-service by 2027)
- **Decision transparency**: Growing regulatory and internal requirements for traceable, auditable procurement decisions
- **Remote/async work**: Demand for tools that facilitate distributed decision-making without endless meetings
- **AI agent adoption**: Emergence of agent-to-agent commerce as AI assistants handle more business processes

**Q: Why us? What unique advantage do we have?**

A: Founder expertise: Serial entrepreneur who built and sold a vertical B2B SaaS company for US$ XXX, participating in hundreds of buying and selling processes over 10+ years. Deep understanding of pain points from both sides.

First-mover advantage: While the vision of neutral AI procurement exists, no one has executed it comprehensively with vendor participation. We're building this AI assistant before market leaders realize the threat.

Proprietary data moat: First-mover data advantage creates network effects. More evaluations → better criteria templates → better vendor intelligence → more attractive to new buyers → more evaluations. This compounds quarterly.

Neutral positioning: Unlike G2 (pay-for-rating model), Gartner (pay-to-play analyst access), or consultants (engagement fees bias toward complexity), Clarioo's only incentive is successful matches – aligning us with both sides.

**Q: Why now?**

A: The window is opening due to converging factors:

1. LLM capabilities reached "good enough" for complex information synthesis (2023-2024)
2. AI software explosion creating acute discovery pain (2024-2025)
3. Buyer fatigue with outbound-dominated GTM creating demand for better tools (2024-)
4. Market acceptance of AI agents in business processes reaching critical mass (2025-)
5. Capital availability for infrastructure plays in AI-native workflows (2025-2026)

In 2-3 years, large incumbents (LinkedIn, G2, Salesforce, Gartner) will enter this space. Our window to establish network effects and market position is now.

**Q: What is the expected financial value? Based on what assumptions?**

A: **Year 1 target:** US$ XXX ARR (300 enterprise clients at US$ XXX ACV + 3,000 SMB clients at US$ XXX ACV + US$ XXX vendor subscriptions)

**Year 3 target:** US$ XXX ARR (1,000 enterprise clients at US$ XXX ACV + 15,000 SMB clients at US$ XXX ACV + US$ XXX vendor subscriptions)

**Year 5 target:** US$ XXX ARR with path to US$ XXX+

Key assumptions:

- 15-20% of B2B software buyers will use AI assistants for procurement by Year 5 (vs. 2% today)
- Average software evaluation frequency: 8 per year for enterprises, 3 per year for SMBs
- Take rate: 3-5% of deal value from vendors (industry standard: 10-20% for lead generation)
- 120% NRR as clients expand usage across organization
- 40% premium feature attach rate for collaboration tools

### Customers and Market

**Q: What market are we entering?**

A: The B2B software market is US$ XXX annually with US$ XXX+ spent on sales/marketing to support vendor discovery and evaluation. The "software evaluation tools" market is nascent, but adjacent markets show the scale: G2 (US$ XXX ARR), Gartner (US$ XXX revenue), procurement platforms (US$ XXX market), sales intelligence tools (US$ XXX market).

**Q: Who are our competitors and how do we position against them?**

A: **Information providers (G2, Gartner):** Provide vendor data but not evaluation workflow or decision support. Pay-for-rating models create bias. We integrate their data while adding neutral assessment and process management.

**Procurement tools (Coupa, SAP Ariba, Zip):** Focus on contracts/compliance, not evaluation. Complex, enterprise-only. We focus on pre-contract evaluation with simpler UX for broader market.

**Consulting advice:** Expensive, slow, human-dependent. We provide AI-speed analysis at 1/10 the cost while keeping human judgment where it matters.

**General-purpose AI (ChatGPT, Perplexity):** General-purpose tools without procurement-specific workflows, vendor engagement, evidence linking, or decision memory. We're purpose-built for this workflow.

Our positioning: "Neutral AI assistant for B2B software buying" – combining information access (like Gartner), evaluation methodology (like consultants), and workflow support (like procurement tools) through an AI assistant.

**Q: How do we know what customers need?**

A: Founder has 10+ years buying and selling B2B software (US$ XXX to US$ XXX+ deals). Over 100 customer discovery conversations in the past 6 months with buyers across:

- Startup CTOs/tech leads (50-200 employees)
- Scaleup CFOs/commercial leaders (200-1000 employees)
- Enterprise IT procurement teams (1000+ employees)

Consistent pain points: decision paralysis, unclear requirements, alignment difficulty, vendor bias, lack of decision memory, post-purchase regret. 80%+ validation that a structured, evidence-based approach would be valuable.

**Q: How do we know customers will use this?**

A: Validation signals:

- **Latent demand:** Companies already create manual versions (spreadsheets, scoring matrices) – 70% of enterprise software purchases use some form of structured evaluation
- **Willingness to pay:** 65% of discovery interviewees indicated willingness to pay US$ XXX-XXX per evaluation
- **Founder network:** 20+ companies committed to pilot/beta participation
- **Time-savings value:** At US$ XXX average fully-loaded cost per employee, saving 40 hours on software evaluation = US$ XXX value, supporting pricing
- **Advisor enthusiasm:** Multiple experienced B2B operators offered to advise/invest based on concept alone

**Q: What channels will we use to reach customers?**

A: **Phase 1 (Months 1-12):** Founder-led outbound to network + content marketing about software buying best practices + virality through evaluation sharing (buyers share assessments with peers/community for validation)

**Phase 2 (Months 12-24):** Vendor as channel – vendors recommend Clarioo to early-stage prospects (helping them qualify faster) + Procurement consultant partnerships + Community-driven templates (users share criteria frameworks)

**Phase 3 (Months 24+):** Inbound at scale through SEO for software category searches + Integration partnerships with spend management/procurement tools + Procurement technology certification/listings

**Q: Who are our founding customers?**

A: Committed beta participants:

- Series B-D scaleups (200-500 employees) making 10-30 software evaluations per year
- Corporate venture/innovation teams at large enterprises constantly evaluating new technologies
- Professional services firms (consulting, PE, VC) conducting diligence for clients/portfolio companies
- Tech-savvy mid-market companies frustrated with current procurement limitations

**Q: What will customers be most disappointed by?**

A: Early version limitations we expect pushback on:

- **Vendor coverage gaps:** Won't have every niche vendor in database (mitigated by allowing manual additions)
- **Evidence quality:** AI assessments won't be perfect; some sources will be incomplete (mitigated by confidence scoring and human validation)
- **Integration limitations:** Won't have integrations with all procurement tools on day one (mitigated by export functionality and API-first architecture)
- **Learning curve:** Some users will want "just give me the answer" vs. structured evaluation (mitigated by two-tier UX: simple fast path vs. comprehensive workflow)

**Q: What might confuse customers?**

A: Potential confusion points:

- **"Is this an RFP tool?"** → No, we precede RFPs. RFP is an optional output, not the core workflow
- **"Does the AI make the decision?"** → No, AI does analysis/recommendation, humans make decisions with full transparency
- **"Will vendors game the system?"** → Minimal risk due to evidence linking and third-party source prioritization
- **"Does this replace our procurement team?"** → No, we arm procurement with better information, not replace them
- **"Free vs. paid is unclear"** → Need clear value gates: free=basic comparison, paid=collaboration+vendor engagement+decision memory

### Product

**Q: What are the core product features?**

A: **Discovery:** Natural language problem description → AI-generated vendor lists with intelligent filtering (stage, size, geography, etc.)

**Criteria Engine:** Conversational requirements gathering → structured, weighted scorecards with evidence sources

**Evaluation:** Automated vendor research across multiple sources → evidence-linked comparison matrices with confidence scores

**Collaboration:** Asynchronous stakeholder input → disagreement highlighting → consensus suggestions → decision alignment

**Vendor Engagement:** Evidence pack validation → contextualized demo booking → real-time meeting co-pilot → post-demo scoring

**Decision Memory:** Complete rationale preservation → accepted risk documentation → stakeholder input history → post-purchase feedback loop

**Vendor Portal (V2):** Lead acceptance workflow → evidence pack management → win/loss intelligence → market positioning analytics

**Q: Why this approach vs. alternatives?**

A: Alternative approaches considered:

**"Marketplace" model** (vendors pay for visibility) → Rejected due to inevitable bias concerns; doesn't solve evaluation problem

**"Human consultant" model** (hire experts to conduct evaluations) → Rejected due to cost structure and scalability constraints; limits addressable market

**"Pure AI assistant" model** (no vendor participation) → Rejected because vendor validation and evidence packs significantly improve accuracy and provide unique value to both sides

**"RFP automation" model** (focus on RFP/RFI workflow) → Rejected because RFPs are late-stage; greater value in earlier evaluation and requirement definition

Our approach "neutral AI assistant with vendor participation" balances:

- Buyer control and neutrality (vs. marketplace bias)
- Speed and cost-effectiveness (vs. human consultants)
- Accuracy and verification (vs. pure AI speculation)
- Early-stage value (vs. RFP focus)

**Q: How will we price the product?**

A: **Buyer side:** Freemium model with three tiers:

- **Basic** (Free): Single user, up to 3 evaluations/month, basic comparisons, limited vendor engagement
- **Professional** (US$ XXX/mo): Unlimited evaluations, collaboration features, full vendor engagement, executive summaries
- **Enterprise** (US$ XXX/mo + per seat): Custom integrations, API access, dedicated support, procurement workflow tools

Alternatively: Per-evaluation pricing at US$ XXX (simple) / US$ XXX (standard) / US$ XXX (complex)

**Vendor side:** Success fee model:

- **Deal fee**: 3-7% of Year 1 contract value (charged only on closed deals vendors confirm through platform)
- **Premium subscription**: US$ XXX-XXX/month for enhanced portal, analytics dashboard, evidence pack management, market intelligence reports, priority placement in relevant searches

Why this works: Buyers pay for time saved and better decisions. Vendors pay for qualified leads (much cheaper than SDRs) and market intelligence (unavailable elsewhere). Success-based pricing aligns incentives.

**Q: How does this fit into the portfolio?**

A: Standalone horizontal AI assistant with potential for vertical expansion. Phase 1 – category agnostic (works for any B2B software). Phase 2+ may add vertical-specific templates and expertise (e.g., "Clarioo for Marketing Tech" with pre-built martech evaluation frameworks).

**Q: How does the AI assistant connect with other tools?**

A: Integrations with:

- **Calendar systems** (Google Calendar, Outlook) for demo scheduling
- **Note-taking tools** (Firefly, Fathom, Notion) for meeting capture
- **Spend management** (Coupa, Zip, LevelPath) for current tech stack visibility
- **Procurement systems** (SAP Ariba) for seamless handoff to contract execution
- **Collaboration tools** (Slack, Teams) for notifications and updates

API-first architecture to enable ecosystem partnerships. Over time, Clarioo may become the "intelligence layer" that other procurement tools integrate for evaluation and scoring capabilities.
