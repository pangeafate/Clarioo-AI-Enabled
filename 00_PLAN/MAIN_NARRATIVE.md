Agentic evidence-first platform

B2B Vendors
Discovery and Buying

Our mission

Help companies discover and buy software:
• 10x Faster and Easier
• Better — with evidence, no voodoo
• More — kill “no decision” or “maybe later” excuses

… and by doing this deliver better leads and conversions for vendors and cut the sales cycle

Today’s human-led software selection is painful and time-consuming, both for buyers and sellers

Today’s process:
Intake ↔ criteria ↔ long-list ↔ RFI/RFP/Demos ↔ evaluation ↔ diligence → award

Human buyers’ problems:
• Hundreds of hours spent on manual research and comparison, w/o evidence
• Painful vendors’ info validation
• Up to 10–15 stakeholders involved
• No decision memory

$10bn+ direct costs, and growing

Human sellers’ problems:
• Long sales cycles (6+ months)
• Real buyers’ needs and criteria are obscure
• Low visibility on deal progress, stall or win/loss reasons
• Vendors sprawl and growing CAC cost

$100bn+ direct costs, and growing

Wasted time, obscure channels, no auditable evidence
Expensive for both sides.

The sources of these inefficiencies are in human nature

80%+ of buyers aren’t domain experts in the tech they are selecting,
and are doing it on top of daily jobs

Marketing noise, rapid new tech emergence, and growing products’ complexity overwhelm buyers

Human biases and Multi-stakeholder sprawl

Lack of trust between buyers and sellers complicate things further

We witnessed this first-hand and know how to fix it

RE: Personal update and opportunity

Hi Olga,
Yes that sounds interesting, hopefully we can replace all the RFI/RFP Excel files and endless PDF files someday! 🙂

Would you mind inviting Michael and Florian — they are also heavily involved in selecting vendors…

Please let us know a time and we will let you know if we can join!
Cheers,
Alex

$2bn+ revenue company. Responded in less than 12h

“I haven’t yet seen anyone tackling this problem so elegantly. I’ll use and my team function will” (CTO, $bn+)

“Sometimes we spend weeks and months just to agree on which features are needed and understand how the vendors are different” (Product Head, $bn+)

Beta in progress…
Demo and Alpha – ready

Early 0-to-1 traction and 1-to-100 growth engine

1. Waitlist is growing:
   20+ companies-buyers (incl. several $bn+ revenue) in waitlist in less than a month.
   From traditional businesses (retail, logistics, pharma) to SaaS / AI scaleups and even roll-ups. Vendors want to be on both sides — use in own buying and get new leads and validate scoring

2. Network effects and communities will drive growth on top of SLG:
   • “1-to-5” users to users — via project collaborators and shareable discovery & selection templates
   • “1-to-10” vendors to users — to improve overall speed / chances in active pipe and re-invigorate old deals process (particularly vendors with better product and “challengers” who benefit from a more objective process)

3. Game theory is on our side:
   • Best vendors participate, and even promote, improving their chances by validating scores and providing more data during sales process
   • Not participating — sending negative signals to the buyers
   $100bn+ Market and Clear Pricing

Vendors:

• $100bn+ already spent on partners’ lead gen and sales enablement / intelligence
• Charging vendors for qualified leads via pay-per-close model (e.g., 5–10% which is lower than current partners, but with much more value add) and deal / category / competitor intel
• Paying for more / better leads, lower CAC, pipe predictability

Partners / Channels & Sales Enablement
$300–400bn Sales & Marketing spent by B2B vendors

Users / Buyers:

• Negligible (e.g., $0–20pm) for single buying / exploring users
• Pro-version for complex enterprise cycles (e.g., $100–200 in 2 weeks vs $30K+ for consultants in 6 months)

$10bn+ direct cost of buying for an organization
3–5x more if includes sub-optimal decisions

Raising $3M+ pre-seed for:

• Production version with key buyers’ steps activated

• 50–100+ mid-enterprise buyers (20+ in waitlist already) >> 400+ initial selection processes >> 2K vendors

• SLG kicked off & Network effects tests (e.g., 2K vendors engaged >> 10K new processes activated)

How it works

Buyer-facing web-app with multi-agents and workflows

Buyer

• Provides context about the company and business need. Validates AI created criteria and vendors list.
• Receives qualified vendors-criteria matrix with evidences, proof packs, confidence and match scores.
• Receives enriched vendor shortlists & pre-meeting buyer prep materials.
• Receives real-time evaluation, decision support & decision memory, alignment of stakeholders.

Clarioo multi-agent system

• Creates scorecards and aligns within organization
• Finds vendors and analyses against criteria
• Fills in criteria-vendors matrix, with evidence

Validate & Enrich

Vendor 1
Vendor 2
Vendor n

• Receives context about the deal. Validates pre-field vendor-criteria. Submits proof packs

• Aligns buyers’ stakeholders based on qualified vendors cards, and prepares for calls w/ vendors

• Co-pilots calls and demos between buyer & vendor. PMO until the deal is closed

• Receives deal status and qualification questions, win/lost reasons, other analytics

Multi-agent and more

Multi-agent architecture with RAG over proprietary data, stateful context management, and recommendation algorithms:

• Each agent powered by specialized RAG: retrieves from historical decisions, vendors knowledge base, previous selection processes or experts templates

• Context propagation between stages: agents maintain memory of user refinements and previous outputs

• Recommendation layer: pattern matching on company context → typical criteria priorities and vendor shortlists

• Agent-specific capabilities, e.g.:
– Criteria Agent → RAG over priority patterns + matching by company type / industry / size
– Vendor Discovery → recommendation algorithms on past shortlists + knowledge graph queries
– Evaluation Agent → multi-source retrieval (vendor-submitted + web + verified data) + cross-model verification with source-level trust scoring

vs. ChatGPT approach: single stateless prompt, no RAG, no orchestration, no proprietary data access
Both sides benefit and “get to yes” faster

For Buyers – Helps regular users and C-suite to cut through the clutter to the decision.
Dopamine hits on the way:

• Clarioo controls the chaos from external noise and internal coordination and opinions
• Eliminates the mundane and difficult analytical work w/o taking power away (yet)
• Helps user look / feel good and more credible internally and with vendors
• No second-guessing – peace of mind and support docs after the decision is made

For Vendors – helps with CRO/CEO main objectives:

• High quality leads with better lead intel – growth
• Much shorter sales cycles – lower CAC
• Real data vs obscure signals or AEs “gut feel” – pipe credibility and predictability
