Press Release (Day 1)

Clarioo launches an agentic, evidence-first platform that makes B2B software discovery and buying 10x faster — with auditable proof, and “decision memory” that eliminates second-guessing

[City, Date] — Today Clarioo announced the launch of its buyer-first, multi-agent platform designed to fix the broken “needs-to-decision” journey in B2B software selection. Clarioo helps companies discover, compare, validate, and choose software 10x faster and easier, with evidence instead of marketing noise, and with decision memory that preserves context and rationale across stakeholders and time.

Software selection today is painful and time-consuming for both sides. Buyers typically move through an intake → criteria → long-list → RFI/RFP/demos → evaluation → diligence → award process that consumes hundreds of hours, involves 10–15 stakeholders, and often leaves no auditable record of why a decision was made. Sellers face long sales cycles (often 6+ months), unclear buyer criteria, low visibility into deal progress and win/loss reasons, and escalating customer acquisition costs driven by vendor sprawl. The result is wasted time, obscure channels, and no auditable evidence — expensive for both sides.

Clarioo’s mission is to help companies discover and buy software:

10x faster and easier

Better — with evidence, no voodoo

More — by killing “no decision” and “maybe later” outcomes

By doing this, Clarioo also delivers better leads and conversions for vendors and cuts the sales cycle.

Clarioo works as a buyer-facing web app that orchestrates multi-agent workflows. Buyers provide company context and business needs, validate AI-created criteria, and receive an evidence-backed criteria-vendor matrix with proof packs, confidence signals, and match scores. Clarioo then produces enriched vendor shortlists and pre-meeting preparation materials, aligns stakeholders, and supports real-time evaluation and decision-making during calls and demos. After a decision, Clarioo provides decision memory and supporting documentation that prevents repeated debates and re-litigation.

Clarioo also engages vendors in a structured “validate & enrich” loop. Vendors receive deal context, validate pre-filled vendor-criteria information, and submit proof packs. This improves data quality for buyers and creates more credible, objective deal progression for sellers, including analytics such as deal status, qualification questions, and win/lost reasons.

Clarioo is built on a multi-agent architecture with specialized RAG over proprietary data, stateful context management, and a recommendation layer that matches patterns in company context to typical criteria priorities and vendor shortlists. Unlike a single stateless chat prompt, Clarioo maintains memory across stages, coordinates work between agents, and improves over time using quality signals and structured validations.

Clarioo’s long-term defensibility is driven by a compounding data moat:

User selection & decision data (company context + criteria + evaluations + choices), enabling pattern learning and compounding advantage with volume

Vendor proprietary data (validated criteria-vendor matrices, product specs, roadmaps, vendor-specific inputs), often unavailable to public tools

Structured edits & validations (human-in-the-loop refinements and collaborative improvements), creating quality signals for training

This flywheel improves market insights, agents’ quality, and trust for all participants.

Early demand is strong, with 20+ company buyers already on the waitlist to become design partners and use Clarioo for real selections — spanning traditional industries (retail, logistics, pharma) and modern SaaS/AI scaleups. Clarioo is currently in beta, with demo and alpha ready.

Availability: Clarioo is onboarding design partners and early buyers.

FAQ
1) What is Clarioo?

Clarioo is an agentic evidence-first platform that helps companies discover and buy B2B software faster and with higher confidence. It orchestrates the selection workflow end-to-end — from criteria definition to vendor discovery, validation, evaluation, and final decision — with auditable evidence and decision memory.

2) What customer problem are we solving?

B2B software selection is slow, manual, and error-prone for both buyers and sellers.

For buyers:

Hundreds of hours spent on manual research and comparison without evidence

Painful vendor information validation

10–15 stakeholders involved, causing alignment drag

No decision memory — teams re-open old debates and repeat work

For sellers:

Long sales cycles (6+ months)

Real buyer needs and criteria are obscure

Low visibility into deal progress, stalls, and win/loss reasons

Vendor sprawl and increasing CAC costs

Overall: wasted time, obscure channels, and no auditable evidence — expensive for both sides.

3) Why does this problem exist? Why hasn’t it been solved?

The root causes are largely “human nature” plus market complexity:

Most buyers are not domain experts in the tech they select (often doing it on top of daily jobs)

Marketing noise, rapid tech emergence, and growing product complexity overwhelm buyers

Human biases and multi-stakeholder sprawl degrade decision quality and speed

Lack of trust between buyers and sellers complicates everything further

These forces create a system where decisions are slow, hard to justify, and easy to abandon (“no decision” / “maybe later”).

4) Who is the customer?

Clarioo is buyer-first: it serves companies buying software across mid-enterprise and enterprise contexts, where selection complexity and coordination costs are high.

It also serves vendors as a secondary user group because vendors benefit from improved deal clarity, faster cycles, and higher-quality leads — but the platform is designed to preserve buyer trust via evidence and neutrality.

5) What is the “Amazon-style” customer promise?

Make software selection 10x easier, faster, and more informed — for both buyers and sellers — by automating 90%+ of the work, removing human-nature inefficiencies, and completing the process in ~90% less time, with auditable evidence and decision memory.

6) What does “evidence-first” mean in practice?

Evidence-first means outputs are tied to auditable proof rather than claims, vibes, or “gut feel.”

Examples:

Each vendor recommendation includes supporting evidence and “proof packs”

The criteria-vendor matrix includes justification per criterion

Confidence signals and match scoring are grounded in sources

Decision outputs produce documentation that can be shared internally (and later audited)

7) What is “decision memory,” and why is it valuable?

Decision memory is the persistent record of:

company context and needs

criteria and priorities

vendor comparisons and evidence

stakeholder inputs and changes

final rationale and supporting docs

Without it, organizations repeat work, second-guess decisions, and lose momentum. With decision memory, they reduce re-litigation, improve alignment, and preserve organizational learning across future purchases.

8) How does Clarioo work end-to-end?

Clarioo is a buyer-facing web app with multi-agents and workflows.

Step 1 — Context & criteria (buyer + stakeholders):

Buyer provides context about the company and business need

Buyer validates AI-created criteria and vendor list

Clarioo creates scorecards and aligns within the organization

Step 2 — Vendor discovery & evidence-building:

Clarioo finds vendors and analyzes them against criteria

Clarioo fills in the criteria-vendor matrix with evidence

Buyer receives a qualified matrix with proof packs, confidence, and match scores

Step 3 — Validate & enrich (vendor loop):

Vendors receive deal context

Vendors validate pre-filled vendor-criteria entries

Vendors submit proof packs
This improves quality and reduces buyer verification burden.

Step 4 — Shortlists & buyer prep:

Buyer receives enriched shortlists and pre-meeting preparation materials

Clarioo aligns stakeholders using qualified vendor cards

Clarioo prepares the organization for calls and vendor interactions

Step 5 — Evaluation, consensus, and close:

Clarioo co-pilots calls and demos between buyer and vendor

Provides real-time evaluation, decision support, and alignment

Acts as PMO until the deal is closed

Vendors receive deal status, qualification questions, win/lost reasons, and analytics

9) How do both sides benefit?

For Buyers (including C-suite and regular users):

Clarioo controls chaos from external noise and internal coordination/opinions

Eliminates mundane and difficult analytical work (without taking power away)

Helps users look/feel credible internally and with vendors

Reduces second-guessing with peace of mind and support docs post-decision

Creates “dopamine hits” along the way: steady progress and clarity

For Vendors (CRO/CEO objectives):

Higher quality leads and better lead intel → growth

Much shorter sales cycles → lower CAC

Real data vs obscure signals or AE “gut feel” → pipeline credibility and predictability

10) What makes Clarioo different from using ChatGPT for vendor selection?

Clarioo is not “a chat prompt.” It is a multi-agent system with:

Specialized RAG per agent retrieving from historical decisions, vendor knowledge, previous selection processes, and expert templates

Stateful context management so refinements persist across stages

Orchestration across workflow steps (criteria → discovery → validation → evaluation → consensus)

Proprietary data access collected through buyer decisions and vendor submissions

A recommendation layer that pattern-matches company context to typical priorities and shortlists

Cross-source retrieval and verification (including vendor-submitted + web + verified data), with source-level trust scoring

In contrast, a typical ChatGPT approach is a single stateless prompt with no orchestration and no proprietary data loop.

11) What is the product’s technical architecture at a high level?

A multi-agent architecture with:

Specialized RAG: each agent retrieves from relevant proprietary and historical sources

Context propagation: agents maintain memory of user refinements and previous outputs

Recommendation algorithms: pattern matching on company context to generate criteria priorities and vendor candidates

Agent roles, such as:

Criteria Agent: priority patterns + matching by company type/industry/size

Vendor Discovery: recommendation algorithms on past shortlists + knowledge graph queries

Evaluation Agent: multi-source retrieval + cross-model verification with trust scoring

12) What is the long-term defensibility?

Clarioo’s defensibility compounds via a data moat that improves market insights, agent quality, and participant trust:

Layer 1: User selection & decision data (core moat)

Company context + criteria + evaluations + choices

Pattern learning

Volume creates compounding advantage

Layer 2: Vendor proprietary data

Validation of AI-created criteria-vendor matrix

Product specs, roadmaps, and other vendor-specific data

Often unavailable to public tools

Vendors are incentivized to provide data to improve ranking and next-step recommendations

Layer 3: Structured edits & validations

Human-in-the-loop refinements

Collaborative improvements

Quality signals for training

The result is a self-improving system embedded in workflows — creating a proprietary flywheel.

13) What is the go-to-market and growth logic?

Growth is driven by a combination of sales-led onboarding and reinforcing network effects:

Waitlist momentum with a mix of traditional and modern companies

Network effects on top of SLG:

“1-to-5” users-to-users via collaborators and shareable discovery/selection templates

“1-to-10” vendors-to-users as vendors contribute data that improves selection speed and re-invigorates old deals (especially challengers who benefit from objectivity)

Game theory incentives:

Best vendors participate (and may promote) because validating scores and sharing data improves their chances

Not participating can send negative signals to buyers

14) What’s the pricing model?

Clarioo pricing is designed to be clear and aligned with who captures value.

Users / Buyers:

Negligible pricing for single buying/exploring users (e.g., $0–20 per month)

A pro version for complex enterprise cycles (e.g., $100–200 in ~2 weeks, versus $30K+ for consultants over ~6 months)

Vendors:

Vendors already spend heavily on lead gen and sales enablement/intelligence

Clarioo charges for qualified leads via a pay-per-close model (e.g., 5–10%, potentially lower than current partners, but with more value add)

Includes value like deal/category/competitor intelligence

Vendors pay for better leads, lower CAC, and improved pipeline predictability

15) What evidence do we have that customers want this?

Early traction includes:

20+ company buyers already on the waitlist to become design partners and use Clarioo for real selections

Strong responsiveness from large organizations (example: a $2bn+ revenue company responded in less than 12 hours)

Qualitative feedback indicating the pain is urgent:

“I haven’t yet seen anyone tackling this problem so elegantly…” (CTO, $bn+)

“Sometimes we spend weeks and months just to agree on which features are needed…” (Product Head, $bn+)

16) What does success look like for the customer?

For buyers:

A shorter path from need to decision

Fewer stalled processes and fewer “no decision” outcomes

Faster stakeholder alignment

Decisions backed by evidence and preserved in decision memory

Better outcomes and reduced risk of sub-optimal choices

For vendors:

Higher-quality, better-qualified opportunities

Shorter sales cycles and lower CAC

Clearer deal progression and credible win/loss insights

Reduced reliance on “gut feel” pipeline management

17) What are the biggest risks and how will we mitigate them?

Risk: Trust and neutrality. Buyers must believe the process is evidence-first, not pay-to-play.
Mitigation: auditable evidence, transparent scoring rationale, and strict separation between vendor submissions and buyer decision integrity.

Risk: Data quality and vendor claims. Vendors may oversell or provide biased inputs.
Mitigation: validation workflows, cross-source retrieval, verification, trust scoring, and structured proof packs.

Risk: Stakeholder complexity. Multi-stakeholder processes can derail adoption.
Mitigation: stakeholder alignment flows, shareable artifacts, decision memory, and in-meeting support.

Risk: Over-automation fear. Buyers may worry about losing control.
Mitigation: human-in-the-loop design; buyers validate key steps; Clarioo removes mundane work without taking power away.

18) What is the simplest way to explain Clarioo in one sentence?

Clarioo is a buyer-first, evidence-first multi-agent platform that automates most of the work in B2B software selection and gets teams to a confident decision faster — with proof and decision memory.
