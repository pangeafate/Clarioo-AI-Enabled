═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
TASK: Analyze each vendor and assign scores (0-100) for TWO dimensions
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

DIMENSION 1 - SOLUTION SCOPE
Position vendors from Single-Purpose specialists to Multi-Function platforms

REFERENCE POINTS - Use these as anchors:

SCORE 0-20 (Single-Purpose Specialists):
• Examples: Calendly (only scheduling), Grammarly (only writing), Loom (only video messages)
• Characteristics: 1-2 core features, solves ONE specific problem, narrow workflow
• Evidence: Simple pricing page with one main feature, "Does X really well" positioning

SCORE 40-60 (Focused Suites):
• Examples: Mailchimp (email + CRM + landing pages), Asana (tasks + projects + timelines)
• Characteristics: 3-5 related features, solves CONNECTED problems, integrated workflow
• Evidence: Feature tabs showing 3-5 main capabilities, "All-in-one for X" positioning

SCORE 80-100 (Multi-Function Platforms):
• Examples: Salesforce (CRM + sales + marketing + service + analytics + apps), Microsoft 365, HubSpot
• Characteristics: 10+ major features, platform architecture, serves MANY distinct use cases
• Evidence: Complex navigation with 10+ product sections, "Platform for everything" positioning

---

DIMENSION 2 - INDUSTRY FOCUS
Position vendors from Vertical-Specific (industry-specialized) to Multiple Verticals (horizontal)

REFERENCE POINTS - Use these as anchors:

SCORE 0-20 (Vertical-Specific - Deep Specialization):
• Examples: Veeva (pharma/life sciences), Epic (healthcare), Blackbaud (nonprofits)
• Characteristics: ONLY serves one industry, deep regulatory/compliance features
• Evidence: Industry-specific homepage, compliance certifications, vertical-only case studies

SCORE 40-60 (Industry-Focused):
• Examples: Shopify (retail/e-commerce), Toast (restaurants), Procore (construction)
• Characteristics: Serves 2-4 related verticals, some industry-specific features
• Evidence: Industry-specific templates, targets 2-3 related sectors, some compliance features

SCORE 80-100 (Multiple Verticals - Horizontal):
• Examples: Slack (messaging for all), Zoom (video for all), Google Workspace
• Characteristics: Used identically across ALL industries, no industry-specific features
• Evidence: Generic case studies across sectors, no vertical-specific pricing/features

═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
SCORING METHODOLOGY - Follow these 4 steps for EACH vendor
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

STEP 1: RESEARCH (Analyze Individual Vendor)
For each vendor, identify:
□ Feature Count: Count distinct major features/capabilities (not sub-features)
□ Use Cases: How many different jobs-to-be-done does it solve?
□ Industry Positioning: Which industries are explicitly mentioned on their website?
□ Industry Features: Any industry-specific features, compliance, or workflows?

STEP 2: COMPARE (Rank Against Other Vendors)
Create two rankings:
□ Solution Scope Ranking: Order all vendors from narrowest (fewest features) to broadest (most features)
□ Industry Focus Ranking: Order all vendors from most horizontal (all industries) to most vertical (one industry)

STEP 3: DISTRIBUTE SCORES (Apply Distribution Logic)

🎯 DISTRIBUTION RULES - READ CAREFULLY:

WHEN TO CLUSTER (scores within 20 points):
✓ All vendors are in the same category (e.g., all project management tools)
✓ No meaningful differentiation in feature scope or industry focus
✓ Example: Asana (45), Monday (52), ClickUp (58) - all mid-range PM tools

WHEN TO SPREAD MODERATELY (30-40 point range):
✓ Clear differences exist but vendors are in related categories
✓ Some vendors are more specialized/focused than others
✓ Example: Simple tool (30), Mid-range suite (55), Comprehensive platform (70)

WHEN TO SPREAD WIDELY (50+ point range):
✓ Extreme differentiation: niche tool vs enterprise platform
✓ Clear tiers: specialist vs suite vs ecosystem
✓ Example: Single-feature tool (15), Suite (55), Enterprise platform (90)

⚠️ CRITICAL: Use the FULL 0-100 scale when appropriate. Don't be conservative.
If you have a true single-purpose tool, score it 10-20, not 40.
If you have a true enterprise platform, score it 85-95, not 70.

STEP 4: CALIBRATE WITH PROJECT CONTEXT
Consider the project's specific use case ({{ $json.project_category }}):
□ Does this vendor position differently for THIS use case?
□ Example: Slack is multi-function (score 75) generally, but for "team chat" use case specifically, it's more focused (score 45)
□ Adjust scores ±10-20 points based on project relevance

═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
REASONING REQUIREMENTS - Your reasoning MUST include these 3 elements
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

For EACH vendor, provide:

1. FEATURES: "Offers [X] core features: [list 2-3 key ones]"
   Example: "Offers 3 core features: email campaigns, basic CRM, landing pages"

2. INDUSTRY: "Targets [industries/verticals] with [evidence]"
   Example: "Targets all SMBs horizontally (generic homepage, cross-industry case studies)"
   OR "Targets healthcare only (HIPAA compliance, EHR integrations, medical billing)"

3. RELATIVE: "Positioned [higher/lower] than [Vendor X] because [specific difference]"
   Example: "Broader than Calendly (1 feature, score 15) but more focused than HubSpot (12+ features, score 85)"

❌ BAD REASONING: "Multi-function platform with broad appeal"
✅ GOOD REASONING: "Offers 8 features (CRM, email, analytics, automation, forms, ads, landing pages, social) vs competitors with 2-4 features. Targets SMBs horizontally across all industries (homepage shows retail, SaaS, agency examples). Broader than ActiveCampaign (score 55, fewer features) but more focused than Salesforce (score 92, enterprise platform)."

═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
FINAL CONSISTENCY CHECK - Validate before returning
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

Before returning your response, verify:

□ 1. Do scores reflect ACTUAL feature/industry differences?
   - If VendorA has 10 features and VendorB has 3, is VendorA scored significantly higher?

□ 2. Are SIMILAR vendors scored similarly (±10 points)?
   - If two vendors are both "email marketing tools", are they within 10 points of each other?

□ 3. Did I use the FULL 0-100 range when appropriate?
   - If I have true specialists and true platforms, do scores span at least 40 points?
   - Am I being too conservative by clustering everyone around 50?

□ 4. Does EVERY reasoning cite SPECIFIC evidence?
   - Feature counts? Industry mentions? Relative comparisons?

□ 5. Are scores distributed logically?
   - If all vendors scored 40-60, is that genuinely accurate or am I avoiding differentiation?
   - If vendors are truly different, do scores reflect those differences clearly?
